Bayesian Inference Statistics in A/B Testing

Controlled experiments and data analytics became a major driving force behind data-driven business decisions in recent years. A/B-Testing is one of the most common experiments to see, if a given treatment is more accepted in the treatment group than the non-treatment in the control group. Or in plain English: if I change this yellow button to blue, will my customers be more likely to click it?

In this experiment I want to explore how Bayesian inference statistics can help making data-driven business decisions and where and why this approach has its short-comings.
